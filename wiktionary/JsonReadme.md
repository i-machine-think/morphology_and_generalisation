# Wiktionary scrape 2.0 
In the two json files `wiktionary_scrape_plural.json` and `wiktionary_scrape_singular.json`, two dictionaries are defined that map a single lowercase word to its IPA form(s) and separation possibilities as listed on Wiktionary. A typical example is:

```
'asterisk': 
   {
     'trennung':
        [['As·te·risk', 'Plural: As·te·ris·ke']],
     'phonetik': 
        ['astəˈʁɪsk']
  }
```
